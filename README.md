Skill Deck is a lightweight, native desktop application for managing and exploring **Skills**—a graphical companion to [`vercel-labs/skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills).

**Key highlights:**
- **Native Rust implementation** — Does not invoke the `skills` CLI binary, no Node.js required
- **Fully compatible** — Uses the same configuration format; CLI and GUI can be used interchangeably
- **Companion, not replacement** — Switch freely between CLI and GUI, or use both side by side

The goal is simple: make Skills easier to inspect, understand, and apply across projects and editors—without changing how they work.

## ✨ Features

- 🗂 **Unified view** — Browse all installed Skills in one place
- 🌍 **Global & project scope** — Manage Skills at global level or per-project
- 🧠 **Clear visibility** — Understand where each Skill is applied at a glance
- 🔄 **Multi-editor support** — Auto-detect installed editors (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) and sync Skills across them
- 📦 **Dual install modes** — Choose between Symlink and Copy when installing Skills
- 🔍 **Discover & install** — Install Skills from GitHub repos or local paths
- 🌐 **Bilingual UI** — English and Chinese interface
- ⚡ **Fast & lightweight** — Built with Tauri v2, fast startup, low resource usage

> ⚠️ Skill disabling is not supported by the underlying model.
> Skills can be installed or removed only.

## 📦 Installation

### Option 1: Download pre-built binaries (recommended)

Download the installer for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/hccake/skill-deck/releases):

- **Windows**: `Skill-Deck_x.x.x_x64_en-US.msi`
- **macOS**: `Skill-Deck_x.x.x_universal.dmg` (Intel + Apple Silicon)
- **Linux**: `skill-deck_x.x.x_amd64.deb` or `skill-deck-x.x.x-1.x86_64.rpm`

> ⚠️ **Early Alpha**: Skill Deck is in early development (v0.x.x). Features and APIs may change frequently.
> - ✅ Great for testing and feedback
> - ⚠️ Back up important configurations before use
> - ❌ Not recommended for production environments yet

### Option 2: Build from source

**Prerequisites**:
- Node.js >= 18
- pnpm >= 8
- Rust >= 1.70
- System dependencies: see [Tauri Prerequisites](https://tauri.app/v2/guides/prerequisites)

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/hccake/skill-deck.git
cd skill-deck

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run in development mode
pnpm tauri dev

# Build for production
pnpm tauri build
```

Build output is located at `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Add a project

Click the `+` button next to "Projects" in the sidebar and select your code project directory.

### 2. Prepare a Skill source

Find the GitHub repo URL or local path of the Skill you want to install. For example:
- `https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills`
- `vercel-labs/skills` (GitHub shorthand)
- `/path/to/local/skill` (local path)

You can also paste a `skills` CLI install command directly — Skill Deck will automatically parse the source, skill names, and target agents from it:

```bash
npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills --skill frontend-design -a claude-code
```

### 3. Install a Skill

Click `+ Add` next to "Global Skills" or any project → enter the Skill source (or paste a CLI command) → select target editors (VS Code / Cursor, etc.) → choose install mode (Symlink / Copy) → confirm.

When a CLI command is pasted, the `--skill` and `--agent` options are automatically pre-selected in the wizard. You can still modify the selections before confirming.

### 4. Use in your editor

Once installed, open the project in the corresponding editor. The Skill will be automatically loaded by the AI assistant.
